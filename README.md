#  Steering Wheel Repair Analysis

This project performs detailed analysis on steering-related repair issues using data cleaning, tagging, and visualization techniques.

##  Files

- `steering_analysis.py` – main Python script
- `cleaned_tagged_steering_data.csv` – cleaned dataset with failure/repair tags
- `platform_issues.png` – top 5 platforms with most issues
- `repair_cost_dist.png` – histogram of repair costs
- `age_vs_cost.png` – scatter plot: repair age vs cost
- `column_analysis.txt` – column-wise data summary
- `analysis_summary.txt` – executive summary

##  Tools Used

- Python:Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab: for analysis and visualization

##  Key Insights

- Material failures (e.g., stitching, peeling) are frequent
- High repair costs observed in BEV and luxury platforms
- Average repair cost: ₹{replace_with_actual_mean}

##  How to Run

Upload the Excel data, run the script in Google Colab or locally using Jupyter Notebook, and export outputs.
