# Steering Wheel Repair Analysis

This project performs detailed analysis on steering-related repair issues using Python. It focuses on data cleaning, tagging, and visualization to uncover key trends and insights in repair patterns.

---

## Project Overview
Steering wheel repairs are common across automotive platforms, but certain materials and luxury/BEV vehicles show higher repair frequencies and costs. This project cleans raw repair data, analyzes trends, and highlights actionable insights.

## Tools Used
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Google Colab:** For running notebooks and visualization  
- **Excel/CSV:** Input data source  

---

## Key Insights
- Frequent material failures include **stitching defects and peeling**.  
- Higher repair costs are observed in **BEV and luxury vehicle platforms**.  
- **Average repair cost:** ₹5,230 *(update with actual mean from dataset)*.

## How to Run
1. Upload your Excel dataset.  
2. Open `Python_Code.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Run the cells sequentially to perform cleaning, tagging, and visualization.  
4. Export outputs as CSV or plots for reporting.

##  Tools Used

- Python:Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab: for analysis and visualization

##  Key Insights

- Material failures (e.g., stitching, peeling) are frequent
- High repair costs observed in BEV and luxury platforms
- Average repair cost: ₹{replace_with_actual_mean}

##  How to Run

Upload the Excel data, run the script in Google Colab or locally using Jupyter Notebook, and export outputs.
